# DiceDetector

Chapters Demonstrated:
- Chapter 3: Loading, Displaying, and Saving (main())
- Chapter 5: Drawing (draw_information())
- Chapter 6: Image Processing (get_dots())
- Chapter 7: Histograms (make_plot())
- Chapter 8: Smoothing and Blurring (get_dots())

Not in book:
- clustering (count_dice_from_dots())
- using built-in contour/shape detection (get_dots())
  - Could have essentailly been replaced with the code found in Chapter 11: Contours, but why do that when you can just have one or two lines instead of 40 :)

How to use:
- press r to record values that appear on screen
- press q to stop the camera and display histogram
- press q again to quit the program
- for best results, a plain background is reccommended
